# Heavy ML wheels — installed as a separate Docker layer.
#
# These packages account for ~2GB of downloaded wheels (PyTorch + CUDA,
# torchvision, diffusers, transformers). By pinning them here and
# COPYing this file before pyproject.toml in Dockerfile.base, Docker
# can cache this layer independently. Edits to lightweight deps in
# pyproject.toml won't trigger a ~15-minute re-download of ML wheels.
#
# IMPORTANT: Versions must match uv.lock exactly. If Layer 1 installs
# a different version than uv.lock expects, Layer 2's `uv sync` will
# either downgrade (wasting the heavy install) or conflict.
#
# To update: bump versions here AND in pyproject.toml, then run
# `uv lock` to regenerate uv.lock.
